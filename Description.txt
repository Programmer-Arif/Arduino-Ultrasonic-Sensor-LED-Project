This is a Arduino and Ultrasonic Sensor project with LEDs to measure the distance of objects like scale.
When an object comes close to the Hc-sr04 ultrasonic sensor it indicates the distance using LEDs.

Requirements:
i) Arduino Uno Board
ii) Hc-sr04 ultrasonic sensor :-
	Range: 2cm to 400cm
	Operating voltage: 5V
	Measuring Angle: 30 degree
iii) Bread board
iv) Jumper wire
v) 7 x LEDs
vi) 7 x 220ohm resistor

When red LED is on - distance of object is 50cm
When yellow LED is on - distance of object is 4cm

Arduino Ultrasonic sensor LED project is somewhat like a scale to find distance measure of an object.
We can easily extend the range of the Hc-sr04 sensor to changing code.
The Hc-sr04 sensor comes complete with ultrasonic transmitter and receiver modules.
